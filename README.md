# SOC-Analysis-Threat-Intel-Dashboard
This project is a professional-grade Security Operations Center (SOC) Dashboard built with Python. It allows security analysts to upload raw log files (like `auth.log` or `syslog`), automatically extract IP addresses using Regex, and cross-reference them with VirusTotal to identify potential threats in real-time.
